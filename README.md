## The Pig Game

This code is a simple implementation of the popular dice game called "The Pig Game". The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a score of 100 or more points.

### Rules

The game follows the following rules:

- Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

### How to Play

To start the game, simply open the HTML file in your web browser. The game will automatically start.

Each player's turn will be indicated by the player's name being highlighted. To roll the dice, click on the "Roll" button. The dice will be rolled and the number rolled will be added to the player's current score. If the player rolls a 1, their turn will end and the next player will start their turn. If the player chooses to hold, their turn total will be added to their score and the next player will start their turn.

To win the game, a player must reach a score of 100 or more points.
